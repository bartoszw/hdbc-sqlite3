{- This is a little hairy.

We have a CSqlite3 object that is actually a finalizeonce wrapper around
the real object.  We use withSqlite3 to dereference the foreign pointer,
and then extract the pointer to the real object from the finalizeonce struct.

But, when we close the connection, we need the finalizeonce struct, so that's
done by withRawSqlite3.

Ditto for statements. -}
